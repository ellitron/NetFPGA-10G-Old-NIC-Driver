The lib directory is used for storing IP cores that are dressed up and 
organized as Xilinx EDK pcores, ready to be composed in an EDK project. 
In EDK, these pcores can have associated software (i.e. its "driver") 
which is kept in the sw/ directory, separated from the hardware for 
that pcore in the hw/ directory. "std" is the name of the standard IP 
library for the NetFPGA-10G platform. Users thus have the ability to 
create a separate library for their own IP if so desired. 

In the example below, we can see how EDK stores the hardware and 
software files for the MDIO pcore.
