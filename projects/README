The projects directory houses individual projects. Although users are 
free here to organize their project's directory however they want, using 
whatever tools they want, EDK projects generally separate hardware and 
software at the root level into hw/ and sw/ subdirectories. 

The example projects below were made using EDK and so exhibit this characteristic. 
 
`-- projects
    |-- loopback_test
    |   |-- hw
    |   `-- sw
    |-- loopback_test_1g
    |   |-- hw
    |   `-- sw
    |-- production_test
    |   |-- doc
    |   |-- hw
    |   `-- sw
